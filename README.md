# PowerMode
Allows you to change the powermode from the taskbar, like you could in Windows 10 with the slider in the battery menu

Features (so far):
- Changing the powermode from the taskbar or in the app settings
- Automatically going to best performance mode when load on the discrete graphics card is detected (only for NVIDIA for now)
- Sending notifications if the powermode automatically changes.
